transfer to a madeup vendor s bank which was located in xxxx on xxxxxxxx i initiated the international wire transfer from my local chase bank \\n\\noriginally i was told by the bank and i have a saved receipt that the funds from the check would not be available until xxxxxxxx however somehow someway they were able to initiate the transfer on xxxxxxxx \\n\\non the morning of xxxxxxxx i found out that the client who i believed was legitimate was in fact fraudulent and had been running check fraud schemes since xxxx at this point i called the bank to alert them and to cancel the wire transfer until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from keeping in contact with the fraudulent client  who doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues to accrue \\n\\nif i were to pay chase the amount they are claiming i owe they would be unjustly enriched by not only do i believe that is a wrong and unfair business practice but it also hurts me and my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell me theres no way they can get in contact with the transfer people its insane to me as a person whos never seen anywhere but the movies this is terrifying for me\"\n        ],\n

but no respond now my bank wants me to pay and i am short the plus another month is added on to what we owed for our mortgage which is and we only have and chase our bank do not want to accept partial payment\",\n          \"i had the misfortune of cashing a check for a fraudulent client on xxxxxxxx that check was for from that check under the fraudulent client instructions i was supposed to transfer to a madeup vendor s bank which was located in xxxx on xxxxxxxx i initiated the international wire transfer from my local chase bank \\n\\noriginally i was told by the bank and i have a saved receipt that the funds from the check would not be available until xxxxxxxx however somehow someway they were able to initiate the transfer on xxxxxxxx \\n\\non the morning of xxxxxxxx i found out that the client who i believed was legitimate was in fact fraudulent and had been running check fraud schemes since xxxx at this point i called the bank to alert them and to cancel the wire transfer until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from keeping in contact with the fraudulent client  who doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues to accrue \\n\\nif i were to pay chase the amount they are claiming i owe they would be unjustly enriched by not only do i believe that is a wrong and unfair business practice but it also hurts me and my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell me theres no way they can get in contact with the transfer people its insane to me as a person whos never seen anywhere but the movies this is terrifying for me\"\n        ],\n

issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from

i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues

my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center

almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell

receipt that the funds from the check would not be available until xxxxxxxx however somehow someway they were able to initiate the transfer on xxxxxxxx \\n\\non the morning of xxxxxxxx i found out that the client who i believed was legitimate was in fact fraudulent and had been running check fraud schemes since xxxx at this point i called the bank to alert them and to cancel the wire transfer until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from keeping in contact with the fraudulent client  who doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues to accrue \\n\\nif i were to pay chase the amount they are claiming i owe they would be unjustly enriched by not only do i believe that is a wrong and unfair business practice but it also hurts me and my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell me theres no way they can get in contact with the transfer people its insane to me as a person whos never seen anywhere but the movies this is terrifying for me\"\n        ],\n

              "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab  is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from

              "21  on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

discussed with a  representative her name is xxxx and she was unprofessional unhelpful and she has an attitude \\ni told her i got a letter from chase asking me to send me additional information before the deadline and she told me sorry sir we closed the case in xxxx favor without waiting for my additional information on i saw a rebill of and posted to my account \\ncan you please close this case in my favor and credit me again those charges because i already returned the items to xxxx and enclosed are copies of  shipping label that xxxx has provided to me to return the items back \\nfrom xxxx website stated that the weight of the package was kg when i dropped the package at xxxx   location and when they received it and confirmed it on their website on from xxxx  website stated that there was a shipment exception  barcode label unreadable and replaced  on email from xxxx on stated that the refund will be on my account within business days\\n\\nemail from xxxx on asking me to send

kg when i dropped the package at xxxx location  email from xxxx on stated that the return was successful and the refund will take up to four business days to be reflected in my original payment account  they send me this email after they got my screenshot from xxxx website stated that the weight was email from xxxx on stated that there will not be any chargeback related to this order xxxx

they refer me to the xxxx xxxx xxxx to see if they can help us save our home first xxxx xxxx from xxxx xxxx xxxx said that he can not help us when i explain to him the problem i have with my mortgage then he call me back and said that he will try and if it does not work he would refund my first payment of a mont later i got a email that my claim was denied by my bank  try to contact xxxx xxxx xxxx but no respond now my bank wants me to pay and i am short the plus another month is added on to what we owed for our mortgage which is and we only have and chase our bank do not want to accept partial payment\",\n          \"i had the misfortune of cashing a check for a fraudulent client on xxxxxxxx that check was for from that check under the fraudulent client instructions i was supposed to transfer to a madeup vendor s bank which was located in xxxx on xxxxxxxx i initiated the international wire transfer from my local chase bank \\n\\noriginally i was told by the bank and i have a saved receipt that the funds from the check would not be available until xxxxxxxx however somehow someway they were able to initiate the transfer on xxxxxxxx \\n\\non the morning of xxxxxxxx i found out that the client who i believed was legitimate was in fact fraudulent and had been running check fraud schemes since xxxx at this point i called the bank to alert them and to cancel the wire transfer until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from keeping in contact with the fraudulent client  who doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues to accrue \\n\\nif i were to pay chase the amount they are claiming i owe they would be unjustly enriched by not only do i believe that is a wrong and unfair business practice but it also hurts me and my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell me theres no way they can get in contact with the transfer people its insane to me as a person whos never seen anywhere but the movies this is terrifying for me\"\n        ],\n
